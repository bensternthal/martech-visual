This repository contains:

1. A d3 / html based visualization of our marketing stack (index.html)
2. A omnigraffle / pdf visualization

Methodology
========
Items were added based on a combination of Heather Crince's Data Pipeline document
and using the following criteria applied to known products:

1. Is the product in use by 1 or more teams?
2. If no, does the product cost greater than $5,000.00 per year.

If the answer to both of the above is a "no" we probably do not need to track it.

D3 Visualization
============
Just run a server and point your browser to index.html. Data is sourced from ```/Data```

Omnigraffle & pdf
=============
```/omnigraffle-pdf``` should be self explanatory.

Icons
====
Icons can be found in ```/icons```.
